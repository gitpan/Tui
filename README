Welcome to Tui, a Text user interface

Description

This toolkit provides a pretty rich set of widgets which you can use to 
build text-mode programs with a 'Gui-like' appearance. It is object 
oriented in design.

Copyright

This program is free software, you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
under the same terms as Perl itself.

Prerequisites

You'll need perl 5 for this, I've only tested it with 5.004 and 5.005. 
You'll need the Curses module by Milliam Setzer, I've used version 1.02.

Installation

Just copying it to your site_perl directory would do it, but if you just 
want to look at it or don't have the right permissions, you could leave it 
in the current directory. There is no compiling involved, it's just perl.
 
 
Demo program

There is a program tuidemo which shows the capabilities of the toolkit. In 
the module itself there is a lot of pod documentation, use perldoc Tui to 
view it.

Future plans

- clean up a lot of code
- tui builder (with code generation)
- navigation with cursor keys
- extension to the editor widget

And anything you ask me for I'll try to put in there
